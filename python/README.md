# Flask Word Guess API

This repository contains a simple Flask API for generating random word guesses. It utilizes Flask-CORS for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and a database instance for retrieving random words.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-CORS

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/flask-word-guess-api.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   - Ensure your database is correctly configured. You may need to edit the database settings in `utils/word_guesses_database.py`.
   - Populate the database with sample word guesses or provide your own dataset.

## Usage

1. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Access the API endpoint to get a random word guess:
   ```
   GET /api/get_random_word
   ```
   This endpoint will return a JSON object containing the randomly selected word guess along with its topic, hint, and answer.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /api/get_random_word**: Retrieves a random word guess from the database.

## Configuration

- **DEBUG**: Set to `True` to enable debug mode.
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing settings can be adjusted in the `CORS` initialization.
