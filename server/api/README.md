# API Directory

This directory contains the implementation of the API for your Flask application.

## Files

- [`__init__.py`](./__init__.py): This file initializes the Flask application and configures it.
- [`controllers.py`](./controllers.py): This file can be used to define additional controller logic if needed. For example, you might define functions here to handle other API endpoints.
- [`routes.py`](./routes.py): This file defines the routes and associated route handlers for the API endpoints.
